## About PavementJogger
"PavementJogger" (PJ) is a motion planning *utility* software that is currently being developed by FTC Team 12331 (as of 8/16/2024). Its purpose is to serve as the high-level path builder for [SynchroPather](https://github.com/KK201431873/SynchroPather), a motion planning software also developed by FTC Team 12331.

PJ is developed using Qt Markdown Language and runs on Qt version 6. The basic premise of the application is a clip positioning and trimming software, aesthetically similar to video editing software such as [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/edit).

NOTE: We have put this project aside due to time constraints.
